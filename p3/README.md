## Largest prime factor

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?



## NOTES

The definition of a prime number is a positive integer that has exactly two positive divisors. However, 1 only has one positive divisor (1 itself), so it is not prime.

Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: Every [[integer]] which is greater than 1 is either prime or composite number.
Prime numbers which can be represented via factors of prime numbers

### Primality Test
- Whether an number is prime or not (boolean result). Integer factorization provides the prime factors for a number.

#### Trial Division
- Easy method and brute force
- Any number N if its divisible by m(a prime) from between 2 to sqrt(N). If its divisible then its a composite number otherwise its Prime.
- Its based on the fact that every factor is $<=sqrt(N)$ and divides the N by $<=(N/2)$.
- Composite test - divide by 2 and prime numbers is the test of composite test. 
- Notice one thing that all the factors are the prime numbers thats why they call the prime as the building block of all the numbers.
- After 2 and 3 the prime numbers takes on the form of (6kÂ±1)
