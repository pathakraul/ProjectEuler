### Smallest Multiple

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20

### Notes
- All numbers are made of the prime numbers which has the prime factorials  
- Since we need to find the least number which is divisible by all the numbers from 1 to 20.
- We can approach the brute force approach which tests the numbers from x to y and divide them sequentially from 2 to 20 for divisibility.
- How to find the x and y and how much to increment the x to reach y.
- Lets take the x as 2520 since for sure x will not be less than this.
- Lets take y as some big number 1000000000 which is incremented by 10.
- Why 10? Because the divisibility test of 20 says that the number's tens digit is divisible by 20 and also its divisible by 10.
